# Deno With Encapsulated Nx

This is a demo showing a _slightly_ modified of using the [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) framework from the [Deno](https://deno.land) team.

The differences between a stock fresh app and this is the change to move the 'components' directory into it's own 'libs' folder so show using the `import_map.json` for isolating out separate parts of your project via import aliases.
